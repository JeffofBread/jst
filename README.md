A custom build of [st](https://st.suckless.org/) made by myself, [JeffOfBread](https://github.com/JeffofBread). If you find any issues or would like to make a recommendation, feel free. This is a major work in progress and will change.

# Authors notes

Im gonna be honest, im just lazy. There are little to no comments yet, this README is pretty empty, etc. This is just temporary, and will be fleshed out in the future, please bear with me for a while until this gets developed further.
